# 📖 The Guide

Learn how to get Theatre.js up and running in an existing or new project, and learn the basics of the UI and API in pages listed below. Optionally watch along with the supplementary [Theatre.js Crash Course video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icR9EIS1q34).

This guide currently assumes that you are comfortable with basic frontend web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Whether you write code or not, if you're interested in animation on the web, we invite you to join the [Theatre.js Discord Community](https://discord.gg/bm9f8F9Y9N); we aim to be inclusive and welcoming.
